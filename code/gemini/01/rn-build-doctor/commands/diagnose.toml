description = "Analyze a React Native build error log and explain the cause and fix"

prompt = """
Ask the user to paste their build error log, then use the diagnose_build_error tool to analyze it.

For each error found:
1. Clearly explain what caused the error in plain language
2. List the recommended fix steps in order
3. If the error is auto-fixable, offer to run apply_fix (confirm with the user before executing with dry_run: false)

If no known patterns are found, ask the user for more context about their RN version and what they were doing when the error occurred.
