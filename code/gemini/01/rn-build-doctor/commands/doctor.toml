Use the check_rn_environment tool to diagnose the current React Native development environment.

Format the results as:
- ✅ Items that are OK
- ⚠️ Items with warnings that should be improved
- ❌ Items with errors that must be fixed

After the check, if there are any issues found, provide clear step-by-step instructions to fix each one, ordered by severity (critical errors first).
