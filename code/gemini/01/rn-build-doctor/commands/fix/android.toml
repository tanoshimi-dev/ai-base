prompt = """
Follow these steps for the Android build error diagnosis and fix workflow:

1. Ask the user for the project path if not already known (or use the current directory)
2. Use get_project_info to read the Android project configuration
3. Check ANDROID_HOME and Java version from check_rn_environment
4. If the user has a build error log, use diagnose_build_error with platform: "android"
5. If auto-fixable errors are found:
   a. Show the user what commands will be run (dry_run: true first)
   b. Ask for confirmation
   c. Run apply_fix with dry_run: false only after explicit user confirmation
6. Common Android fixes to suggest if no specific error is found:
   - cd android && ./gradlew clean
   - Verify ANDROID_HOME is set correctly
   - Check Java version matches Gradle requirements

Always confirm with the user before executing any fix commands.
