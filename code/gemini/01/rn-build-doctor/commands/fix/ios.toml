prompt = """
Follow these steps for the iOS build error diagnosis and fix workflow:

1. Ask the user for the project path if not already known (or use the current directory)
2. Use get_project_info to read the iOS project configuration
3. If the user has a build error log, use diagnose_build_error with platform: "ios"
4. If auto-fixable errors are found:
   a. Show the user what commands will be run (dry_run: true first)
   b. Ask for confirmation
   c. Run apply_fix with dry_run: false only after explicit user confirmation
5. After fixes are applied, remind the user to rebuild and report back if errors persist

Always confirm with the user before executing any fix commands.
